    "   SpaCy are useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically for vision, there is a package called ``torchvision``, that has data loaders for common datasets such as ImageNet, CIFAR10, MNIST, etc. and data transformers for images, viz., ``torchvision.datasets`` and ``torch.utils.data.DataLoader``.\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides a huge convenience and avoids writing boilerplate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will use the CIFAR10 dataset. It has the classes: ‘airplane’, ‘automobile’, ‘bird’, ‘cat’, ‘deer’, ‘dog’, ‘frog’, ‘horse’, ‘ship’, ‘truck’. The images in CIFAR-10 are of size 3x32x32, i.e. 3-channel color images of 32x32 pixels in size.\n",
